# codmetric_expert_system
A rule-based expert system built in Python to diagnose common computer boot issues by asking yes/no questions. Developed as part of the Codmetric AI Internship.
# Codmetric Expert System 💻🧠

This is a simple **expert system** developed in Python that diagnoses common **computer boot issues** by asking a series of yes/no questions. The goal is to simulate a basic rule-based AI system, helping users identify potential hardware or software problems during system startup.
